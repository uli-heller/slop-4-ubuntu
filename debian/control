Description: slop - select operations - selects desktop regions
 slop (Select Operation) is an application that queries for a selection from
 the user and prints the region to stdout. It grabs the mouse and turns it
 into a crosshair, lets the user click and drag to make a selection (or click
 on a window) while drawing a pretty box around it, then finally prints the
 selection's dimensions to stdout.
